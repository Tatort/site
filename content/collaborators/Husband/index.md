Shea is a current biological scientist at the University of Florida's NCBS. Shea was co-advised by Dr. Thomas and Dr. Johnson during his masters research. His MS research was focused on the efficacy of discrete by-catch reduction devices (BRDs) on terrapin exclusion and crab capture rates; however, he has a wide range of research interests including movement ecology, conservation ecology, and evolutionary biology of aquatic organisms in freshwater and marine ecosystems.
