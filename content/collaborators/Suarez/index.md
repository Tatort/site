Eric Suarez is currently the South Region Conservation Biologist for FWC’s Wildlife and Habitat Management Section. Eric grew up in south Florida and always had a passion for exploring the few green spaces metropolitan Miami-Dade County had to offer. Nevertheless, he would spend countless hours watching wildlife documentaries and catching lizards in his backyard and local parks. Eric graduated with a B.S. (2010) and M.S. (2015) from the University of Florida’s Wildlife, Ecology and Conservation department. Eric has spent most of his career researching freshwater turtle ecology in north Florida and the panhandle. Eric has also spent a good portion of his career working throughout Florida on nonnative wildlife research and management. Eric currently works with various imperiled species throughout south Florida’s system of WMAs. In his personal time, Eric enjoys spending time with family and friends; especially hosting for holidays, sporting events, birthdays, or just to get together and have a good time. More recently, Eric is enjoying raising his child with his wonderful wife. Fishing, snorkeling, canoeing, hiking, camping, are all things Erics really enjoys doing when he has the time.
