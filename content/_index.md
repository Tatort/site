description: I'm a researcher at the [University of Florida's](https://www.ufl.edu/) [**Nature Coast Biological Station**](https://ncbs.ifas.ufl.edu/). I'm interested in *"allcology"* or all-things-ecology & technology. I utilize a variety of techniques to investigate the conservation status of cryptic and imperiled species. My research is primarily focus on reptiles, especially turtles and tortoises, which are typically data deficient or in-decline worldwide.
