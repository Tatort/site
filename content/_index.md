description: I'm a researcher at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) [Nature Coast Biological Station](https://ncbs.ifas.ufl.edu/). I'm interested in "allcology"" or all-things-ecology & technology. I use a variety of tools to investigate the conservation status of cryptic and imperiled species. I primarily focus on turtles and tortoises, which are typically data deficient or in-decline worldwide.
