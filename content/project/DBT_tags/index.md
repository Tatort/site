title: Examining movements of terrapins using satellite tags 
---

We are utilizing small satellite tags (originally designed for penguins) to track terrapin movements in real-time at several sites in Florida. The transmitters are designed and built by [Wildlife Computers](https://wildlifecomputers.com/) and utilize the ARGOS satellite network to estimate locations. Overall, our goal is to better understand homerange size and potentially examine longer open water movements of female terrapins. Look for our findings in 2023!
