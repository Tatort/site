title: Population size and structure of diamondback terrapins on coastal islands in Florida.

Management decisions for species are often based on estimates of abundance, but agencies often times lack  robust estimates of population size for certain species. We conducted a capture–mark–recapture study of terrapins on three adjacent coastal islands in the eastern panhandle of Florida that provided information on population size and demography. To date, our models estimate a population size of >1200 terrapins (867–1905 95% CI) and a density of 150 terrapins/ha.
