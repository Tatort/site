  I'm Dr. Travis M. Thomas, and I'm a researcher at the University of Florida's Nature Coast Biological Station. I'm interested in all-things-ecology & technology. I use a multidisciplinary approach along with modern technology to answer a variety of ecological questions. I can typically be found at the intersection of modern solutions and age old problems.
