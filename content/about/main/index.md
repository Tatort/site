  I'm Dr. Travis M. Thomas, and I'm a researcher at the University of Florida's [**Nature Coast Biological Station**](https://ncbs.ifas.ufl.edu/). Also, I am affiliated with the [**Department of Wildlife Ecology & Conservation**](https://wec.ifas.ufl.edu/). My professional and educational experiences have encompassed many scientific paradigms, and I'm interested in several aspects of population, spatial, and conservation ecology. In addition, I have a passion for emerging technologies and how we can harness them to better understand a variety complex ecological processes. I refer to this smorgasbord of techniques as *allcology*. 
  
  The term *allcology* represents my interest in *all-things-ecology & technology*. Simple put, I like to use a multidisciplinary approach along with modern technology to answer a variety of ecological questions. I can typically be found at the intersection of modern solutions and age old problems.
