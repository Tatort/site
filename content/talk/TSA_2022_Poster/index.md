excerpt:  There is a need to reduce terrapin bycatch mortality in Florida while maintaining the capture of blue crabs. Arendt et al. (2018) used modeling techniques to design and test a 5.1â€“6.4 x 7.3 cm square shaped bycatch reduction device (BRD), which may be more effective than previous rectangle designs. Here, we examine terrapin exclusion probabilities for discrete BRD designs on a theoretical terrapin population based on reported terrapin body sizes in Florida.
