excerpt:  There is a need to reduce terrapin bycatch mortality in Florida while maintaining the capture of blue crabs. Arendt et al. (2018) used modeling techniques to design and test a 5.1â€“6.4 x 7.3 cm square shaped bycatch reduction device (BRD), which may be more effective than previous rectangle designs. Here, we examine terrapin exclusion probabilities for discrete BRD designs on a theoretical terrapin population based on reported terrapin body sizes in Florida. Our results agree with Arendt et al. (2018) who designed BRD A based on optimization. Although our results are preliminary, it appears that the square BRD is better at excluding terrapin and allows for the capture of legal sized blue crabs at the same rate as the control. Our research is on going.
